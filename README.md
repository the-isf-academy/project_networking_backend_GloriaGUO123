## API Overview
The "Mood of the Day" API is a collaborative platform inspired by Reddit r/place, allowing users to express their daily moods through emojis. Friends can participate together, contributing their own emojis to create a shared canva of collective feelings. Access to the API is completely private, as friends can only join through a unique access code, ensuring that mood sharing remains within trusted circles. By tracking and showcasing moods through visualisation, this API promotes emotional well-being and enhances communication among users and their friends or family.

**Simple Instruction:**
1. User MUST create a canva first (at least one, multiple canvas are also allowed) before starting to add emojis
2. User can add emojis to a specific canva, and collaborate with friends, family to form a art piece
3. If users accidentally create an unwanted canva or emoji, they can also delete it. 
3. User can view all the emojis added to a canva or all the canvas that the user has created, but access code will be needed to ensure privacy

**Important Notice**
- For each canva, each user can only add in ONE new emoji during Morning (4:00 AM to 11:59 AM), Afternoon (12:00 PM to 5:59 PM), and Evening (6:00 PM to 3:59 AM)
- Please note that the maximum canva size is 4x4 (meaning that ONLY 16 emojis are allowed for each canva)
- The editing access of the canva will be locked after 24 hours of the `created_time`, as each canva should represent the mood of the day. 
- Please remember the access code for each canva or else the user can not access the canva anymore

✅:
access_code = 1,2,5,6
access_code = 1
access_code = 9,1
access_code = 1    ,      2   , 3
