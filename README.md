## API Overview
The "Mood of the Day" API is a collaborative platform inspired by Reddit r/place, allowing users to express their daily moods through emojis. Friends can participate together, contributing their own emojis to create a shared canva of collective feelings. Access to the API is completely private, as friends can only join through a unique access code, ensuring that mood sharing remains within trusted circles. By tracking and showcasing moods, this API promotes emotional well-being and enhances communication among users and their friends or family.
