## API Overview
The "Mood of the Day" API is a collaborative platform inspired by Reddit r/place, allowing users to express their daily moods through emojis. Friends can participate together, contributing their own emojis to create a shared canva of collective feelings. Access to the API is completely private, as friends can only join through a unique access code, ensuring that mood sharing remains within trusted circles. By tracking and showcasing moods through visualisation, this API promotes emotional well-being and enhances communication among users and their friends or family.

**Simple Instruction:**
1. User MUST create a canva first (at least one, multiple canvas are also allowed) before starting to add emojis
2. User can add emojis to a specific canva, and collaborate with friends, family to form an art piece
3. If users accidentally create an unwanted canva or emoji, they can also delete it. 
3. User can view all the emojis added to a canva or all the canvas that the user has created, but access code will be needed to ensure privacy

**Important Notice**
- For each canva, each user can only add in ONE new emoji during Morning (4:00 AM to 11:59 AM), Afternoon (12:00 PM to 5:59 PM), and Evening (6:00 PM to 3:59 AM)
- Please note that the maximum canva size is 4x4 (meaning that ONLY 16 emojis are allowed for each canva)
- The editing access of the canva will be locked after 24 hours of the `created_time`, as each canva should represent the mood of the day. 
- Please remember the access code for each canva or else the user can not access the canva anymore

***Access Code Format Guide***

For endpoints that ALLOWS multiple access code to be inputed, please do remember that the format to input the access code is crutial, or else it would cause an error. Essentially, user must place `,` (commas) between each access code, or else it will not recognise it as individual integers, causing error to happen. 

*Examples*
```
‚úÖ:
access_code = 1,2,5,6
access_code = 1
access_code = 9,1
access_code = 1    ,      2   , 3

‚ùå:
access_code = 1`2`2
